  <h2>1. Full-Service Listings: Traditional Model with Maximum Support</h2>

    <p>Personalized marketing campaigns including professional photography and open houses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expert pricing advice backed by market data and Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Oversight of inspections, appraisals, and paperwork</p>

<h2>What It Is</h2>
<p>A <strong>flat fee realty Idaho</strong> model allows sellers to list their home on the MLS by paying a fixed, upfront fee-often between $300 and $700-rather than a percentage commission. Sellers usually handle showings, negotiations, and paperwork themselves or purchase optional add-ons.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Commission Structure</h2>
<p>Sellers typically pay no listing agent commission but still offer a buyer's agent commission (usually 2.5-3%) to incentivize buyer agents.</p>
<h2>Ideal For</h2>

    <p>Experienced sellers comfortable with DIY management</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sellers aiming to save thousands on commissions</p>

<h2>What It Is</h2>
<p>Discounted commission brokers offer traditional full-service Realtor benefits-such as MLS listing, marketing, and negotiating-for a reduced commission rate, often 1.5% to 3% on the listing side.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>MLS listing with active marketing efforts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Negotiation assistance and transaction support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduced commission still incentivizes buyers' agents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often flexible packages or à la carte service options</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Commission Structure</h2>
<p>Reduced overall commissions, with fees adjusted based on selected services and coverage.</p>
<h2>Ideal For</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sellers wanting professional support with cost savings</p>

    <p>Those desiring some hands-off involvement but lower fees than traditional full-service</p>
